# Embedded Systems - Project1: Cooperative Scheduler
This project is done for the Embedded Systems Course in the American University in Cairo Spring 2021. <br/>
Instructor: Dr. Mohamed Shalan <br/>
Done By: Dareen Hussein (ID: 900170917), Marwa Sulaiman (ID: 900172284)

## The Cooperative Scheduler Logic:
There is a struct named "Task" which contains the task pointer, priority and task name. The scheduler has 2 Tasks queues; the readyQueue and the delayQueue. The tasks in the ready queue are sorted based on their priorities, when a dispatch is called, the task in the front of the queue will be popped and executed. The delay queue holds the tasks that are still sleeping, and sorts them based on their delay time. After each clock tick the delay time decrements in all tasks in the delayQueue, once one of these tasks have delay = 0, it'll be transfered from the delay queue to the ready queue to be then sorted based on its priority and later executes.

## Softwares and Languages Used:
* This project is developed using STM32CubeMX and Keil Î¼Vision to run on the Nucleo-32 board.
* The language used to develop the scheduler is C.

## Main Data Structure:
Srtuct Task, it contains:
1. Function Pointer
2. Task Name
3. Task Priority

Struct Node, it contains:
1. The Task
2. Task Delay
3. Pointer to next node

Struct Queue, it contains:
1. Queue Type *(D for delay , R for ready)*
2. Pointer to the head of the Queue *(the queue is an array of tasks, each has a function pointer and a priority)*

## Main Functions:
* void Systick Handler()
  * Gets called everytime the SysTick handler throws an interrupt. It also increments the counter variable. This variable is used to keep track of the cycles spent in a certain task function (that is essentially doing its job in time units more than a single systick and hence skipping cycles where the rest of the main program isn't doing its regular dispatching). 
* void QueTask(Task task)
  * This function enqeues a task using its function pointer into the main readyQueue. The requirements specification document states that the scheduler should handle up to 8 priority levels.
* void Dispatch()
  * This function gets called in our while(1) loop every time the SysTick throws an interrupt every 1 time unit. It checks if the ready queue is not empty. It then dequeues the highest priority task from the queue and executes it. It sets the timerFlag to zero so as to not dispatch again until the Systick timer raises the flag once more (i.e. the timer has counted 1 tick = 50ms). If the queue is empty it output "IDLE" to the user.
* void QueDelayedTask(Task task, int delay)
  * This function manages the process of adding delayed tasks to the delay queue and sort them ascendingly according to delay time.
* void DecrementDelayed()
  * This function checks that 50 ms have passed then decrement the delay of each task in the delayed queue by 1 then reset the counter again to 0. 
* void ReRunMe(int delay)
  * This function is used by tasks to rerun themselves periodically every specified delay time units. If the delay is 0, then this task is by definition ready and can be enqueued in the readyQueue. Otherwise, if the delay is greater than 0, then this task is by definition is to be enqueued in the delay queue using its delay values. If the delay option is set to 0 by the task within its function then this means that this task is always ready and will always remain in the main queue because it inserts itself everytime its executed in it through the rerun function.
* void Init()
  * This is the first function called in the main. Here, all the basic initialization (clock, UART, Systick, and interrupts) is done. Furthermore, the ready and delayed priority queues are instantiated besides there qeue heads are initialized.
* int main()
  * This is where the while(1) loop exists and where all of the functions are called.

# Applications
We developed two applications each of which has its source code in its corresponding branch in branchs Application1 and Application2.

## For Application1: Tempreature Sensor

## For Application2: Parking Sensor

# Unit Tests
## For the Compiled C file
### Test1: ReRunMe(0)
We have 3 Tasks (A,B,C). Task A here is the task with the highest priority, and will use ReRunMe with 0 delay time.<br/>

### Test2: Scheduling of 3 Tasks
We have 3 Tasks (A,B,C). Task C has the highest priority then B then A. A reruns itself after 3 ticks, while B reruns itself after 5 ticks. The expected output is the execution of C->B->A then the readyQueue will be empty for 2 tickS then it will start executing A->B->A->B and so on. <br/>

### Test3: Attempting to input an invalid priority number
We're trying here to give TaskA an invalid priority number, to test the program since the schedueler supports 8 priority levels.<br/>
